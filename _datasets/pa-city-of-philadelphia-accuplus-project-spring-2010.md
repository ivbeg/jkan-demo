title: Accuplus Project Spring 2010
notes: "Tiled orthogonal imagery of the City of Philadelphia created from nadir imagery. The data was originally collected for use in orthorectification of ortho mosaics and oblique delivery. \r\n\r\nThe 2010 data was captured by Pictometry International between March 17 and May 5, 2010. The City of Philadelphia notes, \"Automatic aerial triangulation (AAT) was performed. The triangulated frames were rectified to a Pictometry Produced LiDAR derived DEM. Rectification: Ortho-rectification was performed using Inpho's OrthoMaster software. A LiDAR based DEM was used as the rectification surface.\""

title: Philadelphia Lobbying Information System (PLIS)
notes: "The Philadelphia Lobbying Information System is a searchable database of registered lobbyists, principals and lobbying firms as well as lobbying expenses\r\n\r\nThe data was collected to comply with City Code Chapter 20-1200 (and Board Regulation No. 9) and more generally to provide the public insight as to the outside interests who speak with City government officials to influence policy.  Data was submitted to PLIS by lobbyists, lobbying firms, and principals.  The intended audience for this data is anyone with an interest in the people lobbying City government.  The data collected by PLIS is a public record intended to make the legislative and executive process more transparent by providing the public with a clear picture of all of the outside interests involved in policy discussions."

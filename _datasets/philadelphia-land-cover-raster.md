title: Philadelphia Land Cover Raster
notes: 'The Philadelphia Land Cover Raster provides data on the types of surfaces in Philadelphia in 2008. The data identifies seven categories: tree canopy, grass/shrub, bare earth, water, buildings, roads, other paved surfaces. The data primarily was intended to demonstrate tree canopy levels in Philadelphia. When tree canopy covers another surface type, that area is placed in the tree canopy category. The data was gathered with the assistance of the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory.'

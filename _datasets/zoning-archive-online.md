title: Zoning Archive Online
notes: 'Zoning Archive Online is a searchable online database of scanned zoning and other license and inspections documents, organized by property location. Users enter an address and browse corresponding scanned document images, which are arranged in reverse chronological order within each location record. Some historical records date as far back to the 1970s. Data can also be exported as JPG image files. The database was developed and is maintained by the City of Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections.'

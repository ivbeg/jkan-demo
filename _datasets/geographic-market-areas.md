title: Geographic Market Areas
notes: 'From the metadata: "GMAs (Geographic Market Areas) define the geographic areas within which home sales will be compared during the reassessment analysis. GMAs are determined primarily by differences in sale prices, housing stock and/or geographical factors. As GMAs are created based on the specific market conditions and the assessment year, GMAs should be analyzed and updated at regular intervals based on the fluctuating market conditions and before creating reassessment models."'

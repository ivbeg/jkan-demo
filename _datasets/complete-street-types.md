title: Complete Streets
notes: 'The Complete Streets Layer combines the Street Types developed by the City Planning Commission’s Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan, with the Complete Streets Handbook of the Mayor’s Office of Transportation and Utilities. It allows developers, planners, engineers and community groups to easily identify their street type and associated pedestrian, bicycle and other travel priorities to be included during the planning of new streets or large developments.'

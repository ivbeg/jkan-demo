title: Healthy Corner Store Locations
notes: "Contains location data for both Healthy Corner and Enhanced Healthy Corner Store.\r\n\r\nHealthy Corner Store:\r\n\r\nHealthy corner store owners agree to stock and market 4 new healthy food items in at least two categories (fruits and vegetables, dairy, whole grain products, proteins, snacks/beverages). Owners also agree to implement marketing materials (banners, stickers, signs) in their stores encouraging customers to make healthy choices. Stores making these required changes receive a $100 incentive each year.  Currently, toolkits are being developed for store owners to assist them in marketing and selling healthier foods.  \r\n\r\nStoreowners also receive at least one individualized training session on healthy food procurement and marketing. All stores automatically become members of the Philadelphia Healthy Corner Store Network and are eligible for the next level of engagement. \r\n\r\nEnhanced Healthy Corner Store: \r\n\r\nHealthy corner stores that meet specific criteria receive one-on-one training and assistance to introduce cost-efficient changes in their stores to increase their capacity to sell healthy foods.  In addition to specialized training, these stores also receive infrastructural changes, which include shelving and refrigeration to display and store fresh produce; inexpensive outdoor sidewalk stands for fresh produce and increased shelf space to stock bottled water and healthy snacks.

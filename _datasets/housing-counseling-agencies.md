notes: 'OHCD has long supported neighborhood-based and citywide organizations offering housing counseling services to low- and moderate-income people. OHCD-funded services provided by these agencies include mortgage counseling, default and delinquency counseling, tenant support and housing consumer education. Through these services prospective homeowners can avoid predatory loans, a significant cause of foreclosure.'

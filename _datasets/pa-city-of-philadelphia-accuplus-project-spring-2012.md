title: Accuplus Project Spring 2012
notes: 'The dataset consists of tiled orthogonal imagery produced from nadir images captured by Pictometry International during the period of 2012-03-30 to 2012-04-28 in Philadelphia, PA. Automatic aerial triangulation (AAT) was performed. The triangulated frames were rectified to a Pictometry Produced LiDAR derived DEM. Mosaicing was performed using an automatic seaming algorithm and manually edited to eliminate seams through elevated features where possible.'

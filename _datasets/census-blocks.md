notes: "The basic unit of aggregation published by the US Census Bureau.  Population statistics published for redistricting are distributed at the block level.  In an urban area, this corresponds to approximately one city block.  This block map has been altered to improve accuracy and align with the City of Philadelphia's street centerline."

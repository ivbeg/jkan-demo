title: Police Service Areas
notes: "There are currently 65 Police Service Areas (PSA) boundaries in Philadelphia with two to four per District. These boundaries replaced a much smaller boundary, Sectors in 2009. In several Districts, PSA's split Sector boundaries and therefore a historical comparison would not necessarily be accurate."

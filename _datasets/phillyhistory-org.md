notes: "PhillyHistory.org is an online database of historic photographs and maps from the Philadelphia City Archives and four additional area institutions. A project of the City of Philadelphia Department of Records, the database contains images dating back to the 1850s and can be searched by geographic criteria such as address, intersection, place name, and neighborhood as well as keyword, date, collection, topics, and other criteria. Images and maps are associated with a location using the database's geocoding feature. Users can create a free account to save images, bookmark searches, and submit error reports."

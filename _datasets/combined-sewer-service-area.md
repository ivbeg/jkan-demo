title: Combined Sewer Service Area
notes: "This layer is dissolved and queried from PWD's internal sewer shed feature class named modelsheds. The polygons in this layer are catchments for sanitary, storm and/or combined sewer flows. These catchments are used in the hydraulic models. Data DevelopmentBase Modelsheds are maintained regularly and delineate waste water and stormwater and combined sewer catchments in Philadelphia. Storm water and waste water pipe flow are analyzed to delineate the shed boundaries."
